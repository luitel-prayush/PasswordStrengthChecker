# 🔐 Password Strength Checker and Suggested Secure Password

This simple python and flask project is intended to take in a sample password from a user and check for the overall strength of the password, entropy in bits, and how many times this password has been part of a data breach

This project has also been enhanced to suggest a randomly generated secure password based on the length that the user specifies(min 12 char, max 64 chars)
